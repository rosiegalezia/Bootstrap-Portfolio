# Bootstrap-Portfolio
Personal portfolio created using Bootstrap to practice using Bootstrap and making responsive pages.

## Description

This project is a second iteration of a personal portfolio website. It is a developed version of the website created last week (https://github.com/rosiegalezia/week-2-portfolio), improved and made more responsive thanks to the use of Bootstrap 5.

It resolves some of the issues from the first iteration, mainly the problems with responsiveness, and utilises cards and bootstrap icons for improved user experience.

Building this website was a good opportunity to practice using bootstrap and become familiar with its advantages, as well as to observe some of the disadvantages. The main disadvantage encountered was an issue whereby parts of the site were being hidden by the fixed bootstrap navbar. A workaround was created, as can be seen in lines 12-20 of the CSS style sheet.
